# Semantic Segmentation
The task in this project is to classify if a pixel in an image is road pixel or non road pixel. A fully convolutional network is used to perform this task.

### Network Architecture
The fully convolutional network is built upon a pretrained VGG16 network


### Network Training

### Samplet Network Outputs
The trained network is used to classify testing data in Kitti Road Dataset. The following are few sample network output images
